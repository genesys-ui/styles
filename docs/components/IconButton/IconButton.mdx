# Icon Button

## Base

This is the Icon Button without adding any modifier class. You always have to include an icon as a child.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

## Modifiers

### Sizes

Those are the different sizes defined for the Icon Button adding a modifier class (`--xs`, `--sm`...).

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

### Full width

The Icon Button can fit the full width of a parent (`--is-wide`).

<Canvas of={Stories.FullWidth} />

### Circular

The Icon Button can be circular (`--circular`).

<Canvas of={Stories.Circular} />

### Bold icon

you can get a bold icon with a class modifier (`--bold`).

<Canvas of={Stories.BoldIcon} />

### Color scheme

We can get several color scheme for the Icon Button. Each one has been created
with a specific purpose, there is a hierarchy and there are limitations for
using them.

#### High hierarchy

We have `accent-high` and `accent` on the top of the hierarchy. The first one is used usually
only once by page; it's the main action of the page or functionality. The second one can be used
several times by page, but usually it's the main action of a block.

<Canvas of={Stories.HighHierarchy} />

#### Low hierarchy

We have `neutral`, `quiet`, `blend-base` and `blend-inverse` on the bottom of the hierarchy.
The first one is used when the action is not the main of the block. The second one when
the action is not important, there is a neutral one for the main block, or we don't want
to add too much color to the context. The two last ones are used when the Icon Button has a
colored surface as background.

<Canvas of={Stories.LowHierarchy} />

#### Status

We have `error`, `success`, `warning`, `info` and `help` and they are used as the main action in status contexts: error,
success, warning... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Status} />

### States

We can apply several states for the Icon Button, so we can get multiple combinations of variants and states. The most common
states are `disabled`, `focused`, `hovered`... etc.

#### Disabled

We can get the disabled state visual styles by the modifier class `icon-button--disabled`, the `disabled` attribute or the
`aria-disabled` attribute. For accessibility reasons we recommend always adding
only the last one: `aria-disabled="true"`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

#### Hovered, focused and pressed

We can get the same visual styles as pseudo classes `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` with modifier classes
(`--hovered`, `--focused`, `--pressed`).

<Canvas of={Stories.BasicStates} />

#### Expanded and selected

When the Icon Button is expanded o selected we get specific visual styles with modifier classes or aria attributes.

<Canvas of={Stories.AdvancedStates} />

## Cases

The Icon Button has several cases with little nuances based in a specific modifier classes.
The size and other modifier classes (`--sm`, `--error`, `--disabled`... etc.) can be used together
with the case modifier class.

### Icon Button Status

It's used usually as a trigger of an Inline Message block.
Each status use a specific icon as in the examples.

<Canvas of={Stories.CaseStatus} />

### Icon Button Close

It's used usually as a close button for a Modal, InlineMessage, Toast... etc.
You don't have to include an icon as a child because it's included by ::after pseudo-element.

<Canvas of={Stories.CaseClose} />

### Icon Button Collapse

It's used usually as a button to collapse/uncollapse content blocks as in an Accordion or expandable content.
You don't have to include an icon as a child because it's included by ::after pseudo-element.

<Canvas of={Stories.CaseCollapse} />

### Icon Button Remove

It's used usually as a button to remove content blocks as in a Select multiple or filter chips.
You don't have to include an icon as a child because it's included by ::after pseudo-element.

<Canvas of={Stories.CaseRemove} />
