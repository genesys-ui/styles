# Label

## Base

This is the most basic version of the component and its default appearance.
We recommend use the `label` HTML tag only when it has the 'for' attribute
in pair with a field control or when it acts as a wrapper of it. In these last
cases the cursor changes to pointer.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

## Modifiers

This section includes the variants or modifiers that change the appearance of
the base component.

### Sizes

There are several sizes available: `xxs`, `xs`, `sm`, `md` (by default), `lg` and `xl`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

### Wrapper

Sometimes, the label can be the wrapper for both the form control and the label
text, so that the two are associated implicitly. In these cases, you can use the
modifier class `.label--wrapper`, if necessary in combination with position
modifiers.

<Canvas of={Stories.Wrapper} />

### States

This component is only affected by the `required` state.

#### Required

This component adds a `*` to visually indicate that the field is required, as
you can see below:

<Canvas of={Stories.Required} />

### Truncate

In cases where you want to add ellipses to the text you can do it as follows:

<Canvas of={Stories.Truncate} />

### Hide

If you want to hide some label as _Screen readers only_, you can add the following class:
`.label--hide`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Hide} />
