# Button

## Base

This is the button without any specific content and without adding any modifier class:

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

## Elements

Below are some elements that can be added to the base component:

### Text

The button text must always be wrapped with text element (`.button__text`) for
state styles to work properly :

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

### Icon

If you wish, you can add an icon (`.button__icon`) to visually reinforce the
action of the button:

<Canvas of={Stories.Icon} />

## Modifiers

### Sizes

Those are the different sizes defined for the button adding a modifier class:

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

### Full width

The button can fit the full width of a parent:

<Canvas of={Stories.FullWidth} />

### Icon

#### Icon bold

You can add an element modifier to make an icon more bold.

<Canvas of={Stories.BoldIcon} />

#### Icon position

Also, you can add modifiers to manage the icon position: left (by default) or
right.

<Canvas of={Stories.IconPosition} />

### Color scheme

We can get multiple color scheme for the Button. Each one has been created with
a specific purpose, there is a hierarchy and there are limitations for using them.

#### High hierarchy

We have `accent-high` and `accent` on the top of the hierarchy. The first one is used usually
only once by page; it's the main action of the page or functionality. The second one can be used
several times by page, but usually it's the main action of a block.

<Canvas of={Stories.HighHierarchy} />

#### Low hierarchy

We have `neutral`, `quiet`, `blend-base` and `blend-inverse` on the bottom of the hierarchy.
The first one is used when the action is not the main of the block. The second one when
the action is not important, there is a neutral one for the main block, or we don't want
to add too much color to the context. The two last ones are used when the button has a
colored surface as background.

<Canvas of={Stories.LowHierarchy} />

#### Status

We have `error`, `success`, `warning`, `info` and `help` and they are used as the main action in status contexts: error,
success, warning... etc.

<Canvas of={Stories.Status} />

### States

We can apply several states for the Button, so we can get multiple combinations of variants and states. The most common
states are `disabled`, `focused`, `hovered`... etc.

#### Disabled

We can get the disabled state visual styles by the modifier class `button--disabled`, the `disabled` attribute or the
`aria-disabled` attribute. For accessibility reasons we recommend always adding
only the last one: `aria-disabled="true"`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

#### Hovered, focused and pressed

We can get the same visual styles as pseudo classes `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` with modifier classes.

<Canvas of={Stories.BasicStates} />

#### Expanded and selected

When the button is expanded o selected we get specific visual styles with modifier classes or aria attributes.

<Canvas of={Stories.AdvancedStates} />

#### Loading, loading error and success

<Canvas of={Stories.LoadingStates} />
