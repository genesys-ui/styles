# Badge

## Base

This is the most basic version of the component and its default appearance.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />

## Modifiers

### Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

### Has icon

Choose between icons, text, or empty. Is not expected to use with mixed content.

<Canvas of={Stories.Icon} />

### Is empty

<Canvas of={Stories.IsEmpty} />

### Is circular

The format is restricted to square (same width and height), even with long content.

<Canvas of={Stories.IsCircular} />

### Color scheme

Each Badge color scheme is for a specific purpose, there are a hierarchy and usage
limitations.

#### High hierarchy

The main Branded colors `primary` and `secondary` are on the top of the
hierarchy. The `primary` variant is used usually only once by page. The
`secondary` variants can be used several times by page.

<Canvas of={Stories.ColorSchemeHighHierarchy} />

#### Low hierarchy

The `neutral`, `blend-base` and `blend-inverse` variants are on the bottom of
the hierarchy.

The `neutral` variant is used when the element is not the main of
the block. The `blend-base` and `blend-inverse` are used when the badge has a
colored surface as background.

<Canvas of={Stories.ColorSchemeLowHierarchy} />

#### Status

There are five statuses: `error`, `help`, `info`, `success` and `warning`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Status} />

#### Data visualization

These variants extend the available colors to improve data visualization. There
are six variants: `blue`, `green`, `orange`, `purple`, `red` and `yellow`.

<Canvas of={Stories.DataVisualization} />

### Is inverse

This modifier swaps background colors.

#### High hierarchy

<Canvas of={Stories.InverseHighHierarchy} />

#### Low hierarchy

<Canvas of={Stories.InverseLowHierarchy} />

#### Status

<Canvas of={Stories.InverseStatus} />

#### Data visualization

<Canvas of={Stories.InverseDataVisualization} />

## Truncated text

If you need to truncate the text of the badge, you'll have to wrap the
text content and use the `truncated` class in that wrapper.

<Canvas of={Stories.TruncatedText} />
